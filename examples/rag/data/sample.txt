Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed AWS service that provides access to foundation models (FMs)
from leading AI providers such as Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, and Amazon Titan through a single API.

Bedrock allows developers to build generative AI applications without managing infrastructure.
It supports use cases such as chatbots, text generation, summarization, and question answering.

Key features of Amazon Bedrock include:
- Access to multiple foundation models
- Serverless inference with automatic scaling
- Security and privacy built into AWS
- Integration with AWS services like IAM, CloudWatch, and S3

Amazon Bedrock is commonly used in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures,
where external documents are combined with foundation models to produce accurate,
context-aware responses.

Typical RAG workflows involve:
1. Ingesting documents
2. Retrieving relevant context
3. Augmenting prompts with retrieved data
4. Generating responses using a foundation model
